# Picross
I made [Picross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) in MATLAB. I enjoy these puzzles and have completed several versions on my phone, but I've never come across a version that would generate random levels, so I made my own.

Left Click to add or remove squares. Right Click to add or remove Xs. Click and drag to enter squares or Xs in a row or column.
